Soil electrical conductivity (EC) is a metric of the salt content in the soil which will affect crop yield and quality, plant nutrient availability, and the activity of soil microbes. S2105 can be widely applicable in soil sensing scenarios. It is specifically optimized for OTA with built-in Bluetooth, which enables quick setup and update. Benefiting from LoRa and IP66 design, this sensor features stability and reliability and can cover a long transmission range while keeping lower power consumption.

When the NH3or H2S gas concentration reaches the preset threshold, the detector will trigger both LED light alarm and buzzer to notify people timely to ventilate, which is an important part in smart bathroom solution. Apart from local alarms, GS301 can also report the sensor data and alarm messages remotely by the use of LoRaWAN technology. Integrating with Milesight LoRaWAN gateway and Milesight IoT Cloud solution, users can monitor all the sensor data and control the device remotely and flexibly.
