The Lansitec UWB Container Tracker leverages LoRaWAN and UWB technologies to deliver high-precision indoor positioning—up to 10 cm accuracy. By measuring its distance to nearby anchors and forwarding that information to a LoRaWAN gateway, the device’s position is calculated on the server in near real time. Built with a rugged IP68 enclosure and a dual 4000mAh Li/SOCl2 battery, it withstands extreme temperatures, making it ideal for tracking containers or assets in harsh environments.
