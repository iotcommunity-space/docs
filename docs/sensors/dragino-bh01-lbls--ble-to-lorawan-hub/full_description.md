The Dragino BH01-LB/LS BLE to LoRaWAN HubÂ is an edge communication node device designed for loT applications. It uses the BLE Bluetooth module to periodically scan and collect data from surrounding Bluetooth temperature and humidity sensors (such as BCN02, iBeasons or third-party BLE sensors), and then uses the LoRaWAN protocol to transmit the data over long distances to the cloud platform, achieving seamless connection between Bluetooth devices and low-power wide area networks.
