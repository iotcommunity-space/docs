The L02S Bluetooth Asset Beacon / T&H Sensor condition monitoring sensor, based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology, is an all-in-one sensor that contains a temperature sensor, hall effect sensor, and accelerometer sensor. It can monitor the door status and temperatures of the vehicle or trailer and broadcast the data via BLE to be picked up by trackers or BLE gateways and transmitted to the server eventually.
