Just like the MClimate CO2 Display, the lite version is equipped with temperature and humidity sensor, LUX sensor and NDIR CO2 sensor. Featuring smaller 1.54″ e-ink screen the device is showing the current levels of CO2 as well as historical trends. The data from the CO2 Display lite can be used in any LoRaWAN® compatible system, incl. Building Management Systems to control demand-based ventilation. Sensor information can be exposed as datapoints in Modbus, BACnet and KNX systems through the use of a special gateway.
