EM320 LoRaWAN TILT Sensor is used mainly for angle measurement and asset movement detection. With a compact size and 3-axis accelerometer, EM320-TILT can be installed to the objects easily to measure their X, Y, Z tilt angles. In addition, EM320-TILT supports customizing the initial position to detect movement based on angle changes and send threshold alarms. Compliant with the Milesight LoRaWANÂ® gateway and Milesight IoT Cloud solution, users can know the angles and tilt threshold alarms in real-time via browser or mobile app remotely.
