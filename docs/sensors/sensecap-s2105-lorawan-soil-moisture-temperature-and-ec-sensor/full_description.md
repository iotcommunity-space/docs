SenseCAP LoRaWAN S2105 Sensor measures moisture, temperature and EC at the range of 0 ~ 100% (m³/m³), -40 ~ 80℃, and 0 to 23 dS/m respectively. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) is a metric of the salt content in the soil which will affect crop yield and quality, plant nutrient availability, and the activity of soil microbes. S2105 can be widely applicable in soil sensing scenarios. It is specifically optimized for OTA with built-in Bluetooth, which enables quick setup and update. Benefiting from LoRa and IP66 design, this sensor features stability and reliability and can cover a long transmission range while keeping lower power consumption. Unlike wireline devices, it is battery-powered, reducing the workload and complexity of the deployment, and can be disassembled and installed in a few minutes.
