GS301 is a 4-in-1 LoRaWAN bathroom odor detector to detect ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas according to electrochemical principle. GS301 is also able to detect temperature and humidity to fully aware of the environment of bathrooms. When the NH3or H2S gas concentration reaches the preset threshold, the detector will trigger both LED light alarm and buzzer to notify people timely to ventilate, which is an important part in smart bathroom solution. Apart from local alarms, GS301 can also report the sensor data and alarm messages remotely by the use of LoRaWAN technology. Integrating with Milesight LoRaWAN gateway and Milesight IoT Cloud solution, users can monitor all the sensor data and control the device remotely and flexibly. Moreover, GS301 supports Milesight D2D to enable ultra-low latency control without gateways.
