The B003 Bluetooth Beacon is a device that helps you find your
personal belongings quickly and easily. You can attach the beacon
to anything you want to keep track of, and it will buzz when it
communicates with the gateway. The beacon is small and easy
to install. It also helps clients monitor the location, condition, and
utilization of their assets, as well as the whereabouts of their staff.
