The Dragino DDS75-LB/LS is a  LoRaWAN Distance Detection Sensor for Internet of Things solution. It is used to measure the distance between the sensor and a flat object. The distance detection sensor is a module that uses  ultrasonic sensing technology for distance measurement, and  temperature compensation is performed internally to improve the reliability of data. The DDS75-LB/LS can be applied to scenarios such as horizontal distance measurement, liquid level measurement, parking management system, object proximity and presence detection, intelligent trash can management system, robot obstacle avoidance, automatic control, sewer, bottom water level monitoring, etc.
