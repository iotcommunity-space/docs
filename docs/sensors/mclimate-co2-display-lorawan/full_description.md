MClimate CO2 Display LoRaWAN® is a stand-alone CO2 sensor powered entirely by solar energy using an organic solar panel. The device features a 2.9″ e-ink screen, sensor for movement (PIR), temperature and humidity sensor, LUX sensor and NDIR CO2 sensor. The user can see the current levels of CO2 as well as historical trend. The device sends an uplink when it detects movement as well as periodically. The data from the CO2 Display can be used in any LoRaWAN® compatible system, incl. Building Management Systems to control demand-based ventilation. Sensor information can be exposed as datapoints in Modbus, BACnet and KNX systems through the use of a special gateway.
