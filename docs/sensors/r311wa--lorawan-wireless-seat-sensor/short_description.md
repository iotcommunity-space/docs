The NETVOX wireless seat sensor (two-way) R311W A is a device that detects the presence of a seat and is compatible with the LoRaWAN protocol. R311WA will send a message to the gateway if someone is on the seat. When detecting no one on a sensor seat, it will send a normal status message back to the gateway.
