Lorawan Parking Sensor suitable for indoor and outdoor parking detection. It integrates microwave radar and geomagnetic detection technology with advanced signal detection algorithm to accurately realize parking space occupancy detection and parking time statistics. According to the different installation methods, it can be divided into in-ground vehicle detection sensors LW009-IG and surface mount vehicle detectors LW009-SM. When a vehicle pulls into or out of a parking space, the device reports its status to the LoRaWAN gateway. It is powered by a lithium battery and can operate for five years in certain scenarios. Common application scenarios include public parking lots such as industrial parks, on-road parking spaces, community and commercial parking lots.
