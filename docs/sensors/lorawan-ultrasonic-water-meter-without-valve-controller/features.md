Data Reporting: There are 2 data reporting methods.1. Magnetic trigger to report data: The magnet triggers the hall components of the meter module, and the trigger time must be greater than 2S.2. Timed and active reporting (Routine Report): the reporting time slice is automatically allocated according to the Device EUI of the meter module, and the data is reported every 24 hours.
Power Management: It will detect voltages of various states of metering module in real-time and report.
Measurement:Support dual reed switch, dual hall metering mode.
Power-Down Storage:Support power-down storage function, there is no need to re-initialize the measurement value after power-off.
Magnetic Attack Detection:Support magnetic attack detection, it will generate alarm signs when malicious magnetic attack is detected.
Monthly and Yearly Frozen Data Storage:It can save 10 years of annual frozen data and monthly frozen data of the last 128 months, and the cloud platform can query historical data.
Parameters Setting:Support wireless near and remote parameter settings. The remote parameter setting is realized through the cloud platform, and the near parameter setting is realized through the production test tool.
Dredging Valve:It supports the function of timing dredging valve and command dredging valve.
