Sometimes, monitoring the absolute air pressure is unnecessary, but we need to know the difference of pressures in different points. One example may be before and after a valve in a pipe. If the valve is fully open, the pressure on both sides should be the same. If there’s a difference in the pressure, it could be the valve isn’t fully open, or there’s a blockage.
