This surge protector is designed to protect sensitive data-processing equipment connected to a POE (Power over Ethernet) network from transient overvoltages. It is housed in a shielded enclosure with high quality RJ45 shielded jacks. The transient protection circuit is based on high energy gas discharge tubes (GDT) and a network of fast response silicon avalanche diodes (SAD) to achieve sharp clamping of very large surge events, up to 2kA Line/Ground nominal discharge current.
