Milesight EM400 Series, our versatile and powerful distance measuring sensor series, is now offered in both NB-IoT and LoRaWANÂ® versions. By enriching the EM400 Series with NB-IoT versions, we are able to leverage the unique features of NB-IoT technology to broaden the application possibilities of these sensors and provide extra benefits to our customers. By comparison, the EM400 NB-IoT version prevails in situations where gateway deployment is difficult and device deployment is sparse. This version is also advantageous when users require the location data of the objects.
