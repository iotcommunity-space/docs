MClimate Wireless Thermostat is a stand-alone thermostat that can be powered entirely by solar energy using an organic solar panel. The device features a 2.9â€³ e-ink screen, sensor for movement (PIR), temperature and humidity sensor, LUX sensor, and 3 buttons. The user can change the target temperature and see current indoor conditions. The device sends an uplink after any event as well as periodically. For spaces with limited light, it offers flexible power options: with 2 or 4 AA batteries or with a USB-C cable for a non-interrupted power supply.
