The Lansitec UWB Badge Tracker utilizes both LoRaWAN and UWB technologies for high-precision indoor location (up to 10 cm). By measuring distance from nearby UWB anchors and forwarding that data over LoRaWAN, the badgeâ€™s position is calculated on the server side. With a compact, lightweight design and a 600mAh rechargeable battery, this tracker is ideal for monitoring personnel, vehicles, or assets in environments where real-time, highly accurate positioning is crucial.
