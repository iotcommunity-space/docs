This PoE injector is a 30W single port solution
for remote powering the Kerlink’s Wirnet range by AC power supply.
One RJ45 port is for Ethernet input, the other is for Ethernet output + Power.
Two LEDs have diagnostic functions. One “POWER” is for Input Power (green), the other “ACTIVE” is for Output Power (green up to 15,4W and blue above).
