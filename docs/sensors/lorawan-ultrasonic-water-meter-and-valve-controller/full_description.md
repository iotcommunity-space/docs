LoRaWAN Ultrasonic Water Meter and Valve controller is a new type of water meter, that can detect the time difference caused by the change of velocity when the ultrasonic beam propagates along and against the current in the water, analyze the flow rate of the treated water, and further calculate the flow rate of the treated water. There are no moving parts inside, no current blocking elements, no impurities in water, and long service life.
