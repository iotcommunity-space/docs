MClimate has designed the MClimate CO2 Sensor and Notifier in a way that it blends with any interior and doesnâ€™t attract too much attention. Thanks to the fact that it will work on a single pair of batteries for up to 10 years, you can install it and forget about maintenance. Feel free to stick it on a surface or utilize the convenient mounting screws if you want to secure it permanently.
